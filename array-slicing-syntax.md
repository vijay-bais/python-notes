In Python, when using the colon (:) syntax for slicing, the third number after the colon represents the step or stride value, which determines the interval between elements in the resulting slice.

The general syntax for slicing in Python is array[start:stop:step], where:

start: Optional. The index to start the slice from. If omitted, it defaults to 0.
stop: Optional. The index to end the slice at (exclusive). If omitted, it defaults to the length of the array.
step: Optional. The interval between elements in the slice. If omitted, it defaults to 1.

Here's an example using array[::-1]:


# Original array
original_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Slicing with step -1 to reverse the array
reversed_array = original_array[::-1]

# Printing reversed array
print("Reversed array:", reversed_array)

Output:

Reversed array: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]


In this example, original_array[::-1] creates a new slice of the original_array with a step of -1, which means to reverse the array. The resulting reversed_array contains the elements of original_array in reverse order.

So, the third number after the colon (:) in the slice syntax represents the step or stride value, which determines the interval between elements in the resulting slice. In the case of array[::-1], it indicates that the elements should be reversed by taking steps of -1.
